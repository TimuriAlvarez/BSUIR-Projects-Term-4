/*	@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all the following:
 *	1.	@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 *	2.	@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
 * 		For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 *	3.	@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.
